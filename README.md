Ever forget who a character was in a long book or TV series? This web-application is meant to help you remember by providing character listings for books, movies, and TV. 

This web-application will be created using AngularJS, NodeJS, JavaScript, and (likely) MongoDB. The first feature I wish to implement is the ability to add a book/movie/TV-show and update its list of characters. Each character will have a category for their name, first appearance, last appearance, etc. In the future, I would like to add users and some sort of web-like display showing character relations.
