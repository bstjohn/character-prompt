####Description
Ever forget who a character was in a long book or TV series? This web-application is meant to help you remember by providing character listings for books, movies, and TV. 

This web-application uses the MEAN stack: AngularJS, NodeJS, JavaScript, and MongoDB. For more information, please visit meanjs.org.

Currentyl, this application is able to add a book, update its list of characters, and list books and the characters in those books. Each character has a category for their name, chapter itroduced, etc. A log-in feature is also included.

In the future, I would like to add users and some sort of web-like display showing character relations.
